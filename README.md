# YC Prep - Interview simulation app
**Open-sourcing Anima's prep-questions app**

TL;DR: Back in 2018, when our YC interview was scheduled, we built an app to help us prepare for it. Having many companies asking us for a simulated interview, we've decided to rebuild the app using Anima and open-source it ❤️

## How was this created? 
**Most of the code was written automatically with [Anima](https://www.animaapp.com), given a Figma design.**
[Anima](https://animaapp.com/?utm_source=anima-github&utm_campaign=yc-prep&utm_medium=anima-github) converts design into code. In this case, Figma to React.

This was forked from their repo. Thanks Amina team!
